## Abstract

> In this paper, we present an extended evaluation of a course recommender system designed to support students who struggle in the first semesters of their studies and are at risk of dropping out. 
The system, which was developed in earlier work using a student-centered design and which is based on the explainable k-nearest neighbor algorithm, recommends a set of courses that have been passed by the majority of neighbors who graduated from the study program. 
On one hand, the number of recommended courses for struggling students is less than the number they actually enrolled in, suggesting a different path than they actually do. 
On the other hand, recommended courses matched well with those who graduated, i.e., although the course system targets students at risk, students doing well could benefit.
In the present work, we investigate a second type of success---a specific minimum number of courses passed---and compare the results with our first approach from previous work.
With the second type, the information about success is already available after a semester instead of after graduation which allows faster growth of the database and faster response to curricular changes. 
The evaluation of three different study programs in terms of dropout risk reduction and recommendation quality suggests that course recommendations based on students passing at least three courses in the following semester can be an alternative to guide students on a successful path.
